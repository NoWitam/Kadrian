 * `@kadrion/editor-session` over it (D44), and hands the session to
 * `wireEditor`.
 *
 * Nothing here is a domain rule. The function sizes the two canvas boxes from
 * the document, places the grip over the node, converts client pixels, and
 * hands every edit to the session's bus; the session brings the document the
 * bus returns to the preview with `Player.update`, at the time it shows, and
