# D19 — Evaluation API and state shape

- Status: Accepted — by the project owner on 2026-09-22
- Amended by: PR-21 (D42) on 2026-10-03 at the owner's request, 19.4
  (`active` in every node state)
- Date: 2026-09-21
- Supersedes: —
- Related: D03, D12, D14, D15, D16, D17, D18,
  [specification](../spike/vertical-spike.md) §5.1, §10, and open questions Q15
  and Q17

## Context

PR-02 gives `@kadrion/runtime` its first public API, and the specification
forbids deciding such things "implicitly in code". The decisions below are kept
apart from D18 because the renderer of PR-03 is the first consumer of the state
and may have to reshape it, while the arithmetic of D18 should outlive that.

Evidence gathered on 2026-09-21:

- The project owner answered open question Q17 with yes: `validateComposition`
  returns a branded type, and the runtime accepts nothing else.
- A brand made of a `unique symbol` property **survives an object spread**:
  `{ ...validated, durationUs: 1 }` is still assignable to the branded type. A
  spread copy with one field replaced is exactly what an editor command
  produces, so that brand would wave edited documents through unvalidated. A
  brand made of a declared class with a private member does not survive a spread;
  it emits no code and compiles under `erasableSyntaxOnly`.
- D15 says that "a group is composited before its `opacity` is applied". Folding
  a group's opacity into its children is therefore wrong wherever children
  overlap, so a flat list of world-space values cannot describe a frame.

## Decision

The parts are numbered for reference.

**19.1 API.** `evaluateComposition(composition, timeUs)` returns the
`CompositionState`. It is synchronous and pure: no module state, no cache, no
clock. The document is never written, and the state shares no object with it.
The package exports this function, `EvaluationError`, and the state types, and
nothing else.

**19.2 Input.** The only document type is `ValidatedComposition` from
`@kadrion/schema`, which only `validateComposition` produces. The evaluation does
not validate again. The brand is a declared class with a private member (see the
evidence). It is a **static** guarantee with known limits:

- A type assertion or a type predicate that names the brand forges it. ESLint
  rejects both in every package source except
  `packages/schema/src/validate.ts`; tests may forge. The rule sees only forms
  that name `ValidatedComposition`: a type alias, a generic cast helper, or an
  assertion to `ValidationResult` passes it.
- An intersection such as the result type of `Object.assign` keeps it.
- `validateComposition` brands the caller's own object. Whoever still holds a
  mutable reference to it, such as an editor draft, can change it afterwards.
- A spread, `Readonly<>`, `Object.freeze`, and mapped types in general
  (`DeepReadonly`, reactive proxies, drafts) strip it, which fails closed.
- It cannot cross `JSON` or `postMessage`: whatever receives a document there
  validates it again. Two installed copies of `@kadrion/schema` have two
  incompatible brands.

The evaluation reports, as `invalid-document`, exactly the four members it could
otherwise only skip or guess: an animation without keyframes, and an unknown
node type, animation property, or interpolation. The same branches fail
compilation when the schema gains a member that the runtime does not handle.
Every other defect of a forged document — two animations of one property,
keyframes out of order, a missing field — is not detected and has an undefined
result, because the evaluation does not validate again.

**19.3 Errors.** A call outside the domain of D18.1 throws `EvaluationError`,
which extends `RangeError` and carries a `code`. It is an exception and not a
result, because a time outside the composition is a programming error of the
host, as with the frame grid functions of D13; an invalid document is expected
input and gets a result (D17). Callers check `code`, because `instanceof` fails
across realms.

**19.4 State shape.** `{ timeUs, scenes: [{ id, nodes }] }` mirrors the order and
the hierarchy of the document (D16.4). A node state is `{ id, type }`, plus
`position`, `scale`, and `opacity` for every node that has a transform, plus
`children` for a group. All values are local (D18.5). Static properties — colour,
text, asset references, sizes, inline HTML — stay in the document; a renderer
walks the document and the state side by side. The state is built from fresh
objects and is not frozen.

Amended by: PR-21 (D42). A node state is `{ id, type, active }`, plus the
transform and the children as before: `active` says whether the node's own
lifetime contains `timeUs` (D18.6, D42.3). The background has it too. It is
local: a child's `active` does not depend on its group's. No node is left out
of the state, and an inactive node's transform is evaluated like any other. The
type of the field is exported as `LifetimeState`, which every node state type
extends.

## Alternatives considered

- **A `unique symbol` brand** — the conventional choice, rejected on the
  evidence above.
- **Validating inside `evaluateComposition`** — a guarantee at run time, paid
  once per frame. The host validates when it loads a document (P1).
- **A result instead of an exception** — consistent with `validateComposition`,
  but every frame of a render loop would have to unwrap it for an error that
  only a host bug can cause.
- **A flat `nodes` list without `scenes`** — shorter while schema `0.1` allows a
  single scene (D16.2), but it would already decide how several scenes map onto
  one frame. Mirroring the document decides nothing.
- **Copying static properties into the state** — one tree for the renderer, but
  a second copy of the document per frame that can only drift from the first.
- **World-space values** — wrong for group opacity, and nested DOM elements
  compose transforms natively (D03). An editor that needs them for hit-testing
  can derive them from the local values.
- **Freezing the state** — costs a traversal per frame. The types are read-only,
  and a test proves that damaging a returned state does not reach the next
  evaluation.
- **Naming the result "resolved state"** — D14 already uses "resolve" for
  assets. The names are "evaluate" and "state".

## Consequences

- `@kadrion/runtime` depends on `@kadrion/schema`, for types only so far. D12
  allows that edge.
- `@typescript-eslint/no-misused-spread`, part of the lint baseline (D11), flags
  a spread of a branded value. A command should therefore take a `Composition`
  and return a `Composition`; its result is validated again before it is
  rendered (specification P3).
- PR-03 consumes the state. If the renderer needs more than this shape offers,
  for example layout results, that is an amendment of 19.4 and not of D18.
- A document that reaches the page as JSON or through `postMessage` arrives
  without the brand, so the entry point inside the page validates it. That makes
  `@kadrion/schema` part of the runtime build, which open question Q12 has to
  account for. Host-facing entry points of Player and Producer should take
  `unknown` and validate; the brand is for the inside of the engine.
- The guard against forged brands is a lint rule, so an inline `eslint-disable`
  can still silence it outside the runtime sources, where inline configuration
  is switched off altogether. Such a comment is visible in review.

## Verification

- `packages/schema/test/types.test.ts`: what `validateComposition` returns; a
  plain `Composition` is not validated; the brand does not survive an edited
  copy and fails closed under `Readonly<>`.
- `tests/repo/lint-guardrails.test.ts`: assertions and predicates that name
  `ValidatedComposition` are rejected in package sources, allowed in the
  validator and in tests.
- `packages/runtime/test/evaluate.test.ts`: a plain `Composition` does not
  compile (`@ts-expect-error`); the error codes; one forged document per
  reported member.
- `packages/runtime/test/golden-state.test.ts` and
  `packages/runtime/test/determinism.test.ts`: the state mirrors the document
  and shares no object with it; two states share no object and none is frozen; a
  document changed in place yields the new state, so nothing is cached.
- `tests/repo/expected-state.test.ts`: the expected states hold evaluated values
  only, never static properties.
