# Architecture Decision Records

This directory is the decision log for Kadrion. Accepted decisions are
**constraints**: if implementation evidence suggests one must change, stop and
propose a new ADR instead of silently bypassing it (see `AGENTS.md`).

## Provenance of D01–D10

D01–D10 were accepted by the project owner **before** this repository was
bootstrapped. Their authoritative wording is the one-line statement in
`AGENTS.md` ("Accepted architectural decisions"), and each ADR quotes it
verbatim. `AGENTS.md` does not record why the decisions were taken, so these
ADRs do not contain a reconstructed rationale: the **Rationale** section says
"not recorded" until the project owner supplies it. The **Related rules**
sections contain verbatim quotations from `AGENTS.md` only.
`tests/repo/adr.test.ts` fails when a quotation drifts from `AGENTS.md`.

D10 was superseded by D37 on 2026-09-28 (PR-17): the repository is publicly
visible, and the code stays proprietary. `AGENTS.md` lists D37 in its place, so
D37 quotes its decision and related rules verbatim in the same way, and D10
keeps its text as it was accepted.

## Conventions

- **Identifiers** continue the project's own numbering: `D01`, `D02`, … New
  ADRs take the next free number. Identifiers are never reused.
- **File name**: `D<NN>-<kebab-case-slug>.md`.
- **Header**: every ADR starts with `# D<NN> — <Title>` followed by a metadata
  list that contains `- Status: <status>`.
- **Statuses**: `Proposed` → `Accepted` → (`Superseded by D<NN>` | `Deprecated`).
  `Rejected` is kept for the record when a proposal is declined.
- Only the project owner accepts an ADR. A `Proposed` ADR may describe something
  a pull request already implements provisionally; it still becomes `Accepted`
  only by explicit approval.
- Accepted ADRs are immutable in substance. To change a decision, write a new
  ADR that supersedes it and update the status line of the old one.
- An Accepted ADR may receive an additive clarification or amendment on the
  project owner's explicit instruction. Such a change must not silently reverse
  the original decision. It carries an `Amended by` line in the header, with
  its date and a reference: the pull request and the numbered section. A change
  to the substance of the decision still needs a new ADR that supersedes the
  old one.
- Every ADR is listed in the index above with its current status.

## Proposing a decision

1. Copy [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md) to `D<NN>-<slug>.md` with status `Proposed`.
2. Describe the evidence that triggered the proposal (failing test, measurement,
   spike finding) and the alternatives considered.
3. Add the ADR to the index in the same change.
4. Dependent implementation lands only after the project owner accepts it, or
   is clearly marked as provisional until then.
