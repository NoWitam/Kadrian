# Vertical spike specification

- Status: Draft (written in PR-00; refined by the pull requests that implement it).
  The vertical spike is complete (PR-17, 2026-09-28): see the closure in
  [the report](report.md), section 10, and the plan of phase two in
  [`docs/roadmap/phase-2.md`](../roadmap/phase-2.md).
- Authority: `AGENTS.md` ("Current phase", "Reference spike", invariants) and the
  ADRs in [`docs/adr`](../adr/README.md)
- Reading guide: statements taken from `AGENTS.md` are normative. Details this
  document adds are marked **Proposed**. Anything still undecided is listed in
  [§11 Open questions](#11-open-questions) and must not be decided implicitly
  in code.

## 1. Purpose

Prove one narrow end-to-end path through every package boundary before any
single package is built out:

1. One versioned JSON composition is loaded by a browser player.
2. The same runtime renders it in pinned Chromium on the server.
3. A canvas interaction changes the JSON through a typed domain command.
4. An AI-shaped tool call performs an equivalent command.
5. The Producer exports an H.264 MP4 without storing all intermediate frames.

The spike is finished when each proof has recorded evidence
([§5](#5-proofs-and-acceptance-criteria)), not when the code is feature
complete. The spike is allowed to conclude that an accepted decision has to
change; that result is delivered as a proposed ADR, never as a silent
workaround.

## 2. Non-goals

The spike must not turn into a complete editor, media platform, plugin
ecosystem, or Taskio integration. Explicitly outside the current scope:

- Taskio database models, queues, permissions, billing, and multi-tenancy.
- A production REST service or distributed render farm.
- Full timeline UI, advanced trimming, color grading, filters, or transitions.
- A conversational LLM agent or production asset generation pipeline.
- CRDT collaboration, public plugins, 4K, HDR, and desktop/mobile apps.

## 3. Reference composition

### 3.1 Fixed parameters (normative)

| Parameter  | Value                                                                                                                                    |

### 3.2 Inventory (Proposed)

Stable IDs are required for scenes, nodes, clips, animations, and assets. PR-01
fixed the IDs below in the reference composition
(`packages/test-fixtures/src/compositions/reference.json`);
`packages/schema/test/reference-composition.test.ts` fails when the inventory
or its wiring changes.

| ID                    | Kind        | Role in the spike                                                                                 |

| `node-group`          | group       | Contains `node-image` and `node-caption`; shows that children follow the group's transform        |

| `node-title`          | text        | Top-level text; the node moved by the editing proofs (its position is not animated)               |
| `node-caption`        | text        | Second text node, inside the group                                                                |
| `node-custom-html`    | custom HTML | Sandboxed element that displays a value derived from `timeUs`, so drift shows up in golden frames |
| `clip-audio`          | audio clip  | Plays `asset-audio` for the full duration                                                         |
| `anim-title-opacity`  | animation   | Opacity keyframes on `node-title`                                                                 |
| `anim-group-position` | animation   | Position keyframes on `node-group`                                                                |
| `anim-image-scale`    | animation   | Scale keyframes on `node-image`                                                                   |
| `asset-image`         | asset       | Small raster image                                                                                |
| `asset-audio`         | asset       | Short audio file; a generated tone is enough                                                      |
| `asset-font`          | asset       | Pinned font used by both text nodes (see below)                                                   |

Derived requirement: `AGENTS.md` does not list a font, but it requires that
"assets, fonts, randomness, and runtime versions must be explicit or pinned".
Two text nodes therefore imply one explicit, pinned font asset.

Asset provenance (D10): every fixture asset and font that enters the repository
records where it came from and under which licence, and that licence must allow
redistribution in a possibly public repository. Generated assets are preferred.
PR-01 ships no binary assets: the three asset entries carry placeholder hashes
until the binaries arrive (D14). Since PR-06 the three assets are generated from code in
`@kadrion/test-fixtures` (a PNG, a TrueType font drawn for the reference texts,
and a WAV tone), so no binary asset is committed, and the entries carry the
SHA-256 of the generated bytes (D27.5, Proposed).

Keyframe placement rule (Proposed, strengthened by PR-01): for each animated
property, at least one golden timestamp falls exactly on a keyframe, and at
least one falls strictly between two keyframes that have different values,
**away from the midpoint** of that segment. At the midpoint, swapped endpoints
and every symmetric easing give the same value as linear interpolation, so a
midpoint sample does not verify it. The reference composition also samples a
hold before a first keyframe and a hold after a last keyframe.

Expected evaluated state (PR-02):
`packages/test-fixtures/src/compositions/reference.expected-state.json` records
what the runtime must produce at the five golden timestamps. It was derived by
hand from D16.6 and D18, with the derivation next to the numbers, before the
runtime existed, and it is never regenerated from an implementation. Since
PR-03 no animated property has the identity as its base value (image scale 1.25,
title opacity 0.75, group offsets starting at (16, 8)), so the golden states
prove that an animation modifies its base value for all three properties (D18).
One known limit remains: the golden timestamps do not pin the order of the
operations of D18, which 61 of the 300 grid frames do;
`packages/runtime/test/evaluate.test.ts` closes that gap with frame 61.

Expected rendered tree (PR-03):
`packages/test-fixtures/src/compositions/reference.expected-render.json` records
the complete DOM tree that `@kadrion/renderer-dom` must produce at the five
golden timestamps, derived by hand from the expected state and D22. Since PR-04
it also holds the sandboxed frame of the Custom HTML element and, per golden
timestamp, the message the host posts to it and the one acknowledgement it
accepts (D23).

### 3.3 Golden timestamps (normative)

| `timeUs`    | Frame index at 30 fps |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| `0`         | 0                     |
| `2_500_000` | 75                    |
| `5_000_000` | 150                   |
| `7_500_000` | 225                   |
| `9_900_000` | 297                   |

All five frame indices are multiples of 3, so their times are whole
microseconds at 30 fps. The golden frames therefore **cannot** detect an error
in the frame/time mapping; [§4](#4-time-model) requires a separate property
test for it.

## 4. Time model

- Persistent time values are integer microseconds (D04).
- Runtime state for a frame is derived from `(composition, timeUs)` only.
  Runtime animation logic must not depend on `Date.now()`, timers, playback
  history, UI state, or the number of previously rendered frames.
- The frame grid needs one rule **in both directions**, shared by the Player's
  frame stepping and the Producer. The rule is decided by
  [D13](../adr/D13-frame-grid-and-integer-frame-rate.md) and implemented in
  `@kadrion/schema`, in integer arithmetic:
  - `frameToTimeUs(i) = floor(i * 1_000_000 / fps)`
  - `timeUsToFrame(t) = floor(((t + 1) * fps - 1) / 1_000_000)`, which is the
    largest `i` with `frameToTimeUs(i) <= t`
  - At 30 fps the grid is 0, 33_333, 66_666, 100_000, …; frame 299 samples
    9_966_666, and the composition end `10_000_000` is exclusive.
  - The naive inverse `floor(t * fps / 1_000_000)` is wrong for two of every
    three frames (frame 1 samples 33_333 µs, which it maps back to frame 0).
- A **property test over all 300 frames** guards the rule
  (`packages/schema/test/frame-grid.test.ts`): `timeUsToFrame(frameToTimeUs(i)) === i`, `frameToTimeUs` is strictly
  increasing, and every integer `t` inside the composition satisfies
  `frameToTimeUs(f) <= t < frameToTimeUs(f + 1)` for `f = timeUsToFrame(t)`.
- Seeking to a `timeUs` that is not on the frame grid is valid in the Player.
  The Producer samples only grid times.
- Evaluation takes an integer `timeUs` with `0 <= timeUs < durationUs`. Any
  other value is a typed error, never a clamped or rounded time, and the
  evaluation never reads `fps`. How a value between two keyframes is computed,
  bit for bit, is one rule. Both are proposed by
  [D18](../adr/D18-keyframe-sampling-and-arithmetic.md).

## 5. Proofs and acceptance criteria

Each proof lists the evidence that must exist in the repository when it is
claimed. Numbers that can only come from measurement are not invented here.

### P1 — A versioned JSON composition is loaded by a browser player

- The reference composition validates against schema `0.x`; the schema version
  is part of the document, and an unsupported version is an error.
- The Player renders the composition and supports play, pause, and
  `seek(timeUs)`.
- Seeking to a golden timestamp yields the same frame regardless of what was
  displayed before (fresh load, after playback, after seeking backwards).
- The Player loads nothing except the runtime build and the assets declared by
  the document. A missing required asset or font is a typed error.
- Evidence: automated browser test covering the five golden timestamps.
- Status after PR-05 (D25, accepted): `@kadrion/player` and `apps/playground`
  exist, and `packages/player/test` proves the Player's logic in jsdom against
  the real render page, runtime build, and Custom HTML element, through a
  harness.
- Status after PR-06 (D26–D28, Proposed): the automated browser test exists
  (`tests/pinned/player.pinned.test.ts`): the five golden seeks, the same pixels
  after a fresh load, after play and pause, and after a seek back, the
  hand-derived tree, the fixture font only, and the runtime hash of the
  Producer. It passed on the Windows development machine, which is informative
  only. P1 is **not** proven until it passes in the pinned container (D26.2),
  which has not run.
- Status after PR-07 (2026-09-22): the pinned container ran, with
  `--network none` (D28.9). `tests/pinned/player.pinned.test.ts` passed there:
  the five golden seeks, identical pixels after a fresh load, after play and
  pause, and after a seek back, the Player's runtime hash equal to the
  Producer's, and zero differing pixels against the Producer in the same
  browser binary. **P1 holds in the pinned environment** (D28, accepted 2026-09-22).

### P2 — The same runtime renders it in pinned Chromium on the server

- The Producer loads a runtime build artifact that is **byte-identical** to the
  one the Player loads, in a pinned Chromium.
- The Producer renders the five golden timestamps to images. These pre-encode
  frames are the reference output.
- Golden frames are asserted only in the pinned reference environment. Results
  from a developer machine, including the Windows development machine, are
  informative only.
- Repeatability and order independence hold as defined in
  [§6.1](#61-determinism-of-the-reference-output).
- Evidence: golden frames in `@kadrion/test-fixtures`, a test that re-renders
  and compares them in the pinned environment, and a render manifest
  ([§8](#8-producer-requirements)).
- Status after PR-06 (D26–D28, Proposed): `@kadrion/producer` renders frame
  times to PNG and writes the render manifest; `@kadrion/cli` exposes it as
  `kadrion render-frames`; `tests/pinned/producer.pinned.test.ts` checks
  repeatability, order and clock independence, typed errors, the tree, the fonts,
  and pixels that need no golden file. **No golden frame exists yet**: the
  project owner did not run the pinned container in PR-06, so P2 is not proven.
  The golden test fails in the pinned environment until `node --run
goldens:update` has run there.
- Status after PR-07 (2026-09-22): the golden frames exist. They were written by
  the Producer in the pinned container without a network, and a second pass in a
  fresh container produced the same five SHA-256 values; repeatability, order
  independence, and clock independence passed there, and the render manifest
  records the environment. 260 KB in five PNGs and a manifest, no LFS (Q8).
  **P2 holds in the pinned environment** (D28, accepted 2026-09-22).

### P3 — A canvas interaction changes the JSON through a typed domain command

- Dragging `node-title` on the canvas dispatches one typed domain command
  (**Proposed** name: `SetNodePosition`) on the command bus of
  `@kadrion/editor-sdk`. The UI never mutates renderer internals or the DOM
  produced by the runtime.
- Applying the command yields a new document that validates against the schema;
  the Player re-renders from that document.
- Undo applies one inverse patch and restores a document identical to the
  original; redo restores the edited one.
- Evidence: unit tests for the command and its inverse, plus one browser test
  that performs the drag and asserts on the resulting document.

### P4 — An AI-shaped tool call performs an equivalent command

- `@kadrion/ai-sdk` exposes a tool contract (name, description, JSON Schema for
  the arguments) built on the same editor-sdk command.
- A fixture tool call with the same parameters as the P3 interaction produces a
  document whose serialised JSON is byte-identical to the P3 result.
- Invalid arguments are rejected with a typed error and leave the document
  untouched.
- No model is called; the spike uses fixture payloads only.
- Evidence: equivalence test between the UI-issued command and the tool call.

### P5 — The Producer exports an H.264 MP4 without storing all intermediate frames

- The MP4 is verified structurally with `ffprobe`: H.264 video, `yuv420p`,
  expected dimensions, 30/1 frame rate, 300 frames, and an audio stream. Pixel
  comparisons use the pre-encode frames of P2, never the encoded video.
- Streaming is measurable: no frame files appear on disk during a render, the
  number of frames in flight is bounded by a constant, and peak memory does not
  grow with the number of frames rendered.
- Both D07 presets are produced (see Q2 for their meaning in portrait).
- Evidence: an automated export test in the pinned environment with the
  `ffprobe` assertions. Generated media stays out of Git.
- Status after PR-07 (D29, Proposed): `exportMp4` of `@kadrion/producer` and
  `kadrion export` of `@kadrion/cli` stream every frame of the grid into the
  pinned FFmpeg (D29.1) and write an H.264 MP4 with the audio clip muxed.
  `tests/pinned/export.pinned.test.ts` passed in the pinned container without a
  network: both presets structurally as `ffprobe` reads them (300 frames,
  `yuv420p`, 30/1, time base 1/15360, every presentation time, one AAC stream),
  the 300 piped frames equal a `renderFrames` over the full grid and the golden
  frames at the golden timestamps, the `720p` export has the same frames as the
  `1080p` one, no file but the MP4 appeared while exporting, at most two frames
  were in flight, and peak memory did not grow from 60 to 300 frames. Decoded
  video is reported only (42.1–42.7 dB against the pre-encode frames, 26.4–31.3 dB
  against their neighbours). **P5 holds in the pinned environment**, subject to
  the owner accepting D29. The measurements are in D29.

### 5.1 Invariant traceability

Every non-negotiable invariant of `AGENTS.md` maps to at least one criterion.

## 6. Determinism and parity

### 6.1 Determinism of the reference output

In the pinned environment (pinned Chromium, fonts, runtime build):

- **Repeatability**: rendering the same golden timestamp at least three times,
  each in a fresh page, yields identical pixel data.
- **Order independence**: rendering the golden timestamps in ascending,
  descending, and shuffled order yields identical frames per timestamp.
- **Clock independence** (Proposed): the runtime renders correctly when
  `Date.now`, `performance.now`, timers, and `requestAnimationFrame` are
  replaced with functions that throw inside the runtime's realm. PR-02 checks
  this for the evaluation core in Node
  (`packages/runtime/test/determinism.test.ts`); the check inside the page
  follows with the renderer.
- **Lint guardrail** (binding): the pull request that adds the first runtime
  code also adds a lint rule set that rejects `Date`, `Math.random`, timers,
  `requestAnimationFrame`, and `performance.now` in runtime animation logic,
  together with a test that feeds violating source text to the linter and
  asserts the rejection. The dynamic checks above remain the stronger guard.
  - Landed with PR-02: `eslint.config.js` restricts `packages/runtime/src` (since
    PR-03 also `packages/renderer-dom/src`, with a wider list, D20; since PR-04
    also `packages/schema/src`, with one named exception, D24) and
    `tests/repo/lint-guardrails.test.ts` runs the real configuration over
    violating text. Beyond the binding list it rejects `Temporal`,
    `requestIdleCallback`, the `clear*` and `cancel*` counterparts,
    `crypto.getRandomValues`, `crypto.randomUUID`, and the same globals reached
    through `globalThis`, `window`, `self`, or `global`. Inline configuration is
    switched off for these sources, so an `eslint-disable` comment cannot
    silence the guardrail and is itself reported. The ban does not apply to
    other packages: the Producer may wait on a wall clock (§7).
  - The two guards complement each other. The static rules also see code that
    no test exercises and references captured when a module loads; the dynamic
    check also sees what hides behind an alias. The members `random`, `now`,
    `hrtime`, `timeOrigin`, `getRandomValues`, and `randomUUID` are banned on
    any object, which closes the plain alias (`const m = Math`). Still out of
    reach of the static guard: `Reflect.get`, computed member names, and clock
    reads that need no banned name, such as
    `new Intl.DateTimeFormat().format()`. TypeScript currently rejects timers,
    `performance`, and `requestAnimationFrame` in the runtime sources as well,
    because that project has neither DOM nor Node.js types; that layer ends if
    the renderer brings the DOM library into the package.
  - Decided for PR-03 by D20: the renderer and the Custom HTML mount live in
    `@kadrion/renderer-dom`, the guardrail binds every source of that package
    and of `@kadrion/runtime`, and code such as the bounded acknowledgement wait
    of §7 receives its timer from the host. The clock-independence check inside
    the page runs in jsdom since PR-03 (`packages/renderer-dom/test`) and, since
    PR-06, in Chromium (`tests/pinned/producer.pinned.test.ts`; informative until
    it runs in the pinned environment).
  - Decided by D24 (accepted 2026-09-22, PR-04): the schema, which runs inside the page as part of
    the runtime build (D21), is bound as well. Its memo of checked schema
    objects is the one named exception, and it requires `compositionSchema` to
    be deeply frozen. Weak collections, and the members that lead from a frame
    back to the host window (`parent`, `top`, `opener`, `frames`,
    `contentDocument`), are banned in all three packages.

If byte-identical output turns out to be unachievable, that is a spike finding:
record the measured variance and propose an ADR defining the tolerance.

### 6.2 Parity between browser preview and Producer

The Producer is the reference output; browser preview parity is **measured**.

- What is compared: for each golden timestamp, the frame shown by the Player
  after `seek(timeUs)` against the Producer's golden frame, at the same pixel
  dimensions.
- Metric (D33, Proposed): the number and share of pixels that differ, the
  maximum per-channel difference, and a histogram of the differences.
- Where: the public, built `@kadrion/player` in a minimal conformance host, at
  1080x1920 and device pixel ratio 1, with nothing scaled — not the playground,
  whose preview scale and overlay belong to the application (D25.2).
- Thresholds are set after the first measurements and recorded in an ADR (Q9).
  PR-10 measured (see the [spike report](report.md)); D34 (Proposed) proposes
  thresholds, which gate nothing until they are accepted.

### 6.3 Golden frame policy (D26.5)

- Golden frames are produced only by the Producer in the pinned environment,
  never from a developer's everyday browser. Since PR-07 that environment has no
  network either (D28.9), and `goldens:update` refuses to write outside it.
- They live in `@kadrion/test-fixtures`. Updating them is an explicit command,
  and the image diff is reviewed like code.

## 7. Custom HTML sandbox requirements

From D05 and the invariants. The mechanism is **decided by D23** (accepted
2026-09-22): a sandboxed `iframe` (`allow-scripts` only, so an opaque origin)
whose `srcdoc` is a fixed shell with a restrictive Content Security Policy and
the element's instance ID, followed by the document's `html`; and protocol
version 1, `kadrion:time` / `kadrion:time-ack` with `version`, `instanceId`,
`requestId`, and `timeUs`, bound to the exact `WindowProxy` in both
directions. `synchronizeCustomHtml` of `@kadrion/renderer-dom` posts the time to
each frame directly and waits with a timer lent by the host. 7.1 between
elements holds for conforming elements and is measured in jsdom (PR-05) and in
Chromium (PR-06). PR-06 measured, on the development machine: 7.6 holds from
inside the element; self-navigation is refused by the page policy, so 7.3 holds
for it; **WebRTC is not governed by any page policy and resolved its STUN
server name, so 7.3 is not met for WebRTC** (D28, Measurements). All of it is
informative until repeated in the pinned environment. The owner decided on
2026-09-22 (PR-07): the Producer's boundary is the absence of a network — the
reference run uses `--network none` (D28.9), where the WebRTC measurement must
find no STUN/TURN connection and no non-loopback candidate; and an element that
navigates or reloads ends the render with `custom-html-navigated` (D23.9, D29.7).
The Player, in browsers the engine does not control, keeps WebRTC as a
documented limit of the spike. D36 (accepted 2026-09-24) decides the policy:

- Custom HTML in the Player is a host opt-in.
- The Player does not claim network isolation of untrusted Custom HTML.
- Untrusted Custom HTML is disabled by default in the interactive preview.
- The Producer keeps `--network none`.

PR-16 implements it (D36, Implementation).

1. The element runs in an isolated browsing context. It cannot reach the host
   page, the rest of the composition, or another Custom HTML element.
2. It never receives host secrets or privileged host APIs. Capabilities default
   to none, and any granted capability is explicit in the document.
3. In the spike it has no network access; its content comes from the document
   or from declared assets.
4. Time contract: the host pushes `timeUs`, the element renders for that time
   and acknowledges it, and frame capture waits for the acknowledgement. A
   missing acknowledgement within a bounded wait is an error, not a silently
   captured stale frame. (A wall-clock wait in the orchestration layer is
   acceptable because it can only fail a render; it can never change pixels.)
5. Behaviour is identical in the Player and the Producer because both run the
   same runtime build.
6. Negative tests prove that, from inside the element, access to the parent
   document, network requests, and storage all fail.

## 8. Producer requirements

- Pinned Chromium and pinned FFmpeg (D26, D29.1). The reference run has no
  network (D28.9).
- `seek(timeUs)` resolves only when the frame is completely rendered: fonts
  loaded, images decoded, Custom HTML acknowledged.
- All required assets are resolved before the first frame; a missing asset
  aborts the render with a typed error.
- Frames go to FFmpeg through a pipe with backpressure. No per-frame files.
- Output: H.264 in MP4, `yuv420p`, constant 30 fps, audio muxed from
  `clip-audio`.
- Every render writes a **render manifest**: composition hash, runtime build
  hash, schema version, Chromium version, FFmpeg version, font identities,
  preset, frame count, and duration. This is what makes "pinned" observable.

## 9. Editing requirements

- UI and AI use the same command bus. A command is typed, serialisable, and
  validated before it is applied.
- Applying a command produces a new document plus the inverse patch that undo
  needs. Commands are pure with respect to the document: the same document and
  command always give the same result.
- The spike needs exactly one command end to end. More commands are out of
  scope until the five proofs hold.
- The AI tool contract is derived from the command definition so that the two
  cannot drift apart.

- Evidence for P1–P5 exists in the repository and passes in the pinned
  environment.
- The parity numbers of §6.2 are reported.
- Every open question is either answered (by an ADR where marked) or explicitly
  carried forward with a reason.
- A short spike report states what held, what has to change (as ADR proposals),
  and what the next phase should be: [report.md](report.md) (PR-10).
