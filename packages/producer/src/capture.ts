/**
 * Painted, then captured (D28.5). A frame counts as painted when every frame of
 * the page — the host document, the render page, and every Custom HTML frame, on
 * whichever renderer process runs it — has produced two animation frames after
 * the runtime reported the frame ready. The wait runs in an isolated world that
 * the Producer creates in each frame through CDP: its globals are its own, so
 * neither code of an element nor a test that replaces the page's clocks can
 * answer in its place. Capture is `Page.captureScreenshot` on the page's own
 * target, which composites the out-of-process frames; Playwright's
 * `page.screenshot` is not used, because it injects a style sheet into every
 * frame. The Player's browser test measures through the same two functions.
