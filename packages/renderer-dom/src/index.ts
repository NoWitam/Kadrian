/**
 * @kadrion/renderer-dom — DOM/SVG rendering of evaluated state and the Custom HTML mount.
 *
 * `mountComposition` builds the tree of a validated document once, under the
 * host's Custom HTML policy: with every Custom HTML element in a sandboxed
 * frame when the host trusts it, and as an empty placeholder of the same
 * geometry when it does not (D36); `renderState` writes the state that
 * `@kadrion/runtime` evaluated for one instant into it (D20, D22);
 * `synchronizeCustomHtml` pushes that instant to the Custom HTML elements and
 * waits for their acknowledgements with a timer lent by the host (D23);
 * `awaitMediaReady` waits until the frame's images are decoded and its fonts
 * have settled; `resolveAssets` asks the host for the bytes of every asset and
 * verifies their hashes before anything reaches the page (D27.3). None of them
 * reads a clock or keeps anything between calls: the host supplies the state,
 * the timer, the digest, and the font constructor, and the DOM is the only
 * memory. The
 * page entry of the runtime build artifact is `page.ts` (D21), and
 * `renderPageDocument` is the render page that both hosts load around it (D25).
